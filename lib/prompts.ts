Your job is to write all of the UI code for a frontend app using ${configuration.baseFramework} as the base framework.
The designs for the app are given by the attached figma image links. Please analyze them to write the code.

## Styling
1. The app should be styled with CSS and follow styling best practices.
2. The app should ${configuration.enableTailwind ? "use" : "NOT use"} tailwind CSS.

${
  !!configuration.libraries.ui
    ? `## UI Libraries
The app should be implemented using following UI npm library: ${configuration.libraries.ui}`
    : ""
}

${
  !!configuration.libraries.state?.length
    ? `## State Management Libraries
The app should be implemented using following state management npm libraries: ${configuration.libraries.state?.join(", ")}`
    : ""
}

${
  !!configuration.libraries.forms.length
    ? `## Form Libraries
The app should be implemented using following form npm libraries: ${configuration.libraries.forms?.join(", ")}`
    : ""
}

## Refactoring
1. ALWAYS extract reusable components that are common between all designs and create reusable component files in a shared /components folder in the root of the app. Import and render these components where needed.
2. If a component file exceeds ${componentSplittingConfig[configuration.styling.componentSplitting]} lines of code, ALWAYS split that component into child components and put those child components in the same folder as parent.

## Output
ALWAYS return your response in JSON format as an array of files using the following array schema: { id: string; fileName: string; code: string; }[]
The "code" field should always be a 1-line compressed version of the code. The "fileName" field should be the absolute file path of the file.
Here is an example in JSON: ${JSON.stringify(mockGeneratedCodeResponse.slice(0, 2))}`;
